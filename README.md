# scKINETICS
We introduce scKINETICS (Key regulatory Interaction NETwork for Inferring Cell Speed), a dynamical model of gene expression change which is fit with the simultaneous learning of per-cell transcriptional velocities and a governing gene regulatory network. This is accomplished through an expectation-maximization approach derived to learn the impact of each regulator on its target genes, leveraging biologically-motivated priors from epigenetic data, gene-gene co-expression, and constraints on cellsâ€™ future states imposed by the phenotypic manifold.

## Demo

The demo shows the main functionalities of the package including input file generation, GRN construction, EM estimation, visualizations, and the TF ablation experiment.
